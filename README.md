## Task
To work within a team of four developers, in the timescale of three weeks, build a chat room web application for new web developers to share knowledge and information in a respectful environment, using <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>,  <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express.js</b>. Also including additional dependencies via <b>NPM</b> such as <b>Socket.io</b>. Use GitHub’s version control to fork, pull, commit and push changes then deploy application to <b>Heroku</b>.  All code had to be edited with Visual Studio Code’s Integrated Development Environment.

## Summary
This application was developed with <b>React.JS</b> to take advantage of its helpful library of development tools and easy to maintain code, with it’s flexible modular structure. <b>Node.JS</b> has been used with <b>Express.JS</b>, implementing <b>Socket.IO</b> for real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server then finally deployed to <b>Heroku</b>.

<b>Worked On FrontEnd:</b>
I worked on the front end of the application, pair programming with another team member
to enhance the user interaction, ease of use and improved end user message indicators within the chat room. This included styling, randomised color changing message boxes and logging sound effects.  Also  I assisted the backend developers to research and read documentation about Socket io implementing it in to the project.

## Functionality
<ul>
    <li>A chat room with real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.</li>
    <li>Loggin and selection of a range of different technology chat rooms.</li>
    <li>Pop up message boxes with changing colours.</li>
    <li>Login in room sound.</li>
</ul>

## Design
The application has a landing page that users can easily log on to the app with, using there name also having the option to select a room with small icons of the different technologies associated with the room. A message to all users is located in bold on the landing page to let users know to be respectful to others. The colors used are a range of blue tones. The chat room has an algorithm that randomly selects tones within the selected blue theme for sender and receiver messages.
